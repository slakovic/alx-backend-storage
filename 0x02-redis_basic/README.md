0. Writing strings to Redis
mandatory
Create a Cache class. In the __init__ method, store an instance of the Redis client as a private variable named _redis (using redis.Redis()) and flush the instance using flushdb.

Create a store method that takes a data argument and returns a string. The method should generate a random key (e.g. using uuid), store the input data in Redis using the random key and return the key.

Type-annotate store correctly. Remember that data can be a str, bytes, int or float.

2. Incrementing values
mandatory
Familiarize yourself with the INCR command and its python equivalent.

In this task, we will implement a system to count how many times methods of the Cache class are called.

Above Cache define a count_calls decorator that takes a single method Callable argument and returns a Callable.

As a key, use the qualified name of method using the __qualname__ dunder method.

Create and return function that increments the count for that key every time the method is called and returns the value returned by the original method.

Remember that the first argument of the wrapped function will be self which is the instance itself, which lets you access the Redis instance.

Protip: when defining a decorator it is useful to use functool.wraps to conserve the original functionâ€™s name, docstring, etc. Make sure you use it as described here.

Decorate Cache.store with count_calls.
